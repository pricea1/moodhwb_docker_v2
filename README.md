Tasks
-

_note: Don't touch the templates folder in ```/craft``` it will be overwritten on build. Work on the ones in ```app/templates```_

* ```gulp watch``` to start the watch task, at the moment you will have to use a browser extention for live reload.

* ```gulp``` to build for production, all the magic happens and template files will be moved to ```craft/templates```, resources (images/js/css) will be concatinated, minified and wrapped in silk before they end up in ```/public```.

* ```gulp bower``` Injects bower dependencies into ```_layout.html```. This task will run on ```gulp watch``` as well.
_Remember to ```--save``` when installing components_.

Set ```/app``` as server root on development and ```/public``` for production.
